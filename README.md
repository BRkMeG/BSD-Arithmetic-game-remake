# BSD-Arithmetic-game-remake
The remake of Arithmetic, the BSD game.

This is the remake of one of the games in the BSD game collection, Arithmetic (for more information about the original game, visit <a href="https://github.com/vattam/BSDGames/tree/master/arithmetic">here</a>.)
There are some little features: you have only three errors avaible, the screen refreshes everytime you get correct, and you have also a little board displaying your score.
Enjoy!
